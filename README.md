# Hands_on_ML_Projects

This repository contains four mini-projects focused on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Each project demonstrates practical applications of data preprocessing, analysis, model building, evaluation, and visualization using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and OpenCV.

### ðŸ“‚ Project 1: Diabetes Prediction (Classification)
Objective: Train a machine learning model to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical data.
Key Steps:
1. Data Visualization: Plotted detailed graphs for each feature to understand the distribution and relationships.
2. Data Analysis: Conducted statistical analysis to gain insights.
3. Model Training: Trained multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to find the most suitable one for the task.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated and tuned the model to maximize accuracy.
5. Testing: Tested the final model to ensure its effectiveness.
   
### ðŸ“‚ Project 2: Wine Clustering (Clustering Analysis)
Objective: Perform clustering on the wine dataset to group wines into distinct categories based on their attributes.
Key Steps:
1. Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset.
2. Data Analysis: Analyzed the features to determine relationships.
3. Optimal Clusters: Determined the best number of clusters (using methods like the Elbow Method).
4. Correlation Analysis: Identified the two most correlated columns, visualized the clustering with a scatter plot.
   
### ðŸ“‚ Project 3: Movie Recommendation Engine
Objective: Build a recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on user input.
Key Steps:
1. Data Merging: Combined two datasets based on movie titles.
2. Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed data, focusing on important features such as genre, keywords, cast, crew, and overview.
3. Model Development: Developed a content-based recommendation engine using cosine similarity.
4. Functionality: For a given movie as input, the engine recommends the top 10 most similar movies.

### ðŸ“‚ Project 4: Image Preprocessing and Object Detection
Objective: Perform various image preprocessing tasks and apply object detection using pre-trained models.
Key Steps:
1. Image Loading: Loaded images using OpenCV.
2. Color Space Conversion: Converted images to grayscale and HSV color spaces.
3. Image Filtering: Applied Gaussian Blur and custom kernels for smoothing.
4. Edge Detection: Detected edges using the Canny edge detection method.
5. Contours: Found and drew contours based on edges.
6. Histogram Analysis: Computed and visualized histograms for grayscale images.
7. Object Detection: Applied pre-trained object detection models to detect objects (e.g., cars, faces).
